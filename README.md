## 🚀 Quick Start

You can get started with this template in two ways:

### Option 1: Using Dev Container (Recommended)

For the best development experience, especially on Windows, clone directly into a dev container:

1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Use Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
3. **Run**: "Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume..."
4. **Enter repository URL**: `https://github.com/vbartalis/energy-template.git`
5. **Wait for container setup** (automatic dependency installation)
6. **Start development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This approach ensures:
- ✅ Optimal file system performance
- ✅ Fast live reloading on all platforms
- ✅ Pre-configured development environment
- ✅ No local Node.js installation required

### Option 2: Local Development

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.11.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

**💡 Tip**: This project uses [Volta](https://volta.sh/) for Node.js version management. If you have Volta installed, it will automatically use the correct Node.js version (20.11.0) when you enter the project directory.

#### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vbartalis/energy-template.git
   cd energy-template
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
   *Note: If using Volta, the correct Node.js version will be automatically selected.*

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4321` to see your site

### Build for Production

npm run build
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
